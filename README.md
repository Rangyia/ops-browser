# DevOps Project: Browser built with Electron and Node.js 

This is a basic web browser built with Electron for basic browser functionality.  Used to learn how renderers work behind the scenes and reflows/painting effects performance on CPUs.

# Update:

Currently working on other projects at the moment, will wrap back around to this once I get to node.js in my roadmap.
